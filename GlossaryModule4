Sequence: A positionally ordered collection of items

Series: A one-dimensional, labeled array where the data type must be the same for all the data in a given series

Set: A data structure in Python that contains only unordered, non-interchangeable elements

shape: A NumPy attribute used to check the shape of an array

symmetric_difference(): A function that finds elements from both sets that are mutually not present in the other

Tabular data: Data that is in the form of a table, with rows and columns

union(): A function that finds all the elements from both sets

values(): A dictionary method to retrieve only the dictionary’s values

Vectorization: A process that enables operations to be performed on multiple components of a data object at the same time
